# Talculator üìê

A simple 3-dimensional grapher with support for color-coded equations and symbolic computation.

Created with SvelteKit and TypeScript, powered by [Compute Engine](https://cortexjs.io/compute-engine) and [MathLive](https://cortexjs.io/mathlive), and hosted on Github Pages.

## Additional yapping

This project is named after one of my high school teachers. He was... definitely a personality. (if you know, you know ü§ê)

Before I decided to keep the scope of this project small, there were more features I intended to implement. (You can probably see vestigial signs of a few throughout this repository.) I'm going to list a few here as a personal reminder if I ever come back to this project:

- User-facing indicators for invalid expressions
- UI for controlling pan and zoom
- UI for controlling viewport
- UI for controlling graph precision
- Displaying 3D coordinates of point at cursor
- More detailed meshes (e.g. show points/lines of interception, alternate colors with diagonal stripes when two meshes overlap)
- Graphical analysis (e.g. min, max)
